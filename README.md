###How to play:

Tic-Tac-Toe (aka "Noughts and Crosses") is played on a board of 9 cells in a 3 by 3 square. Before the game starts, nominate which player will play as either 'X' or 'O'.

The first player places an ‘X’ in any board cell. The second player then places in ‘O’ in a vacant cell of their choice. The players continue taking turns and marking their desired cells. The winner is the first player to place three of the same marks (‘X’ or ‘O’) in a row. This can be horizontal, vertical or diagonal.

Once a player wins a round, their score will increase by 1, which can be seen at the bottom of the game board. If no winner can be determined, the game will be a tie will be a tie and the board will reset. A total of 5 game can be played per session.
