Tic-tac-toe, the classic 2 play strategy game.

The game is played on a board of 9 cells in a 3 * 3 square.

The first player places an ‘X’ in any cell. The second player then places in ‘O’ in a vacant cell. The players continue taking turns and marking their desired cells. The winner is the first player to place three of the same marks (‘X’ or ‘O’) in a row. This can be horizontal, vertical or diagonal.


Once a player wins a round, their score will increase by 1, which can be seen underneath the game board. If no winner can be determined, the ties counter will increase by one and the next game will stat. A total of 5 game can be played per session.
